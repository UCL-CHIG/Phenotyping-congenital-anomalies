# Phenotyping-congenital-anomalies
This repository covers ICD-10 codes from 3 code lists which can be used to indicate children with congenital anomalies in hospital records in England and Scotland and basic Stata code which we used to indicate children with congenital anomalies in hospital records.

The code lists are:

## 1) the EUROCAT list 
This code list was developed by the EUROCAT network to classify unstandardized text in congenital anomaly registries for surveillance in Europe;

## 2) the Hardelid list 
This code list was developed to identify children with chronic conditions (including congenital anomalies) admitted to hospitals in England. We used a subgroup of Hardelid codes from Chapter 17 of ICD-10 (“Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities”, that is all codes starting with “Q”) to indicate congenital anomalies.

## 3) the Feudtner list 
This code list was developed to indicate children with complex chronic conditions (including congenital anomalies) admitted to hospitals in the United States. Initially it was created using ICD version 9 and it was later updated to ICD-10. Again, we only used a subgroup of Feudtner codes from Chapter 17 of ICD-10.

Details can be found here:

## How do they compare?
We compared prevalence, and risk of prognostic outcomes (hospital readmission and death) according to each code list in England and Scotland. Feudtner code list identified the least prevalent but most severe congenital anomalies. The EUROCAT code list identified the largest and least severely affected group.
